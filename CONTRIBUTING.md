# About our docs

The TensorFlow documentation uses [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/)
and [Jupyter/Colab notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb). The root of [tensorflow.org/](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is in the
`site/en` directory. 

Not all content on tensorflow.org is in `site/en`. Some
project repositories with project-specific documentation are in
[github.com/tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow) and link from `site/en` to where to update the docs.

Also, some content, images, and design elements are not in the `tensorflow/docs` repository.

The API reference is generated from the core
[tensorflow/tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) repository source code
and other projects.
