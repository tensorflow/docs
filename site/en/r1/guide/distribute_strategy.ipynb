        "Another difference to highlight here between Estimator and Keras is the input handling. In Keras, we mentioned that each batch of the dataset is split across the multiple replicas. In Estimator, however, the user provides an `input_fn` and have full control over how they want their data to be distributed across workers and devices. We do not do automatic splitting of batch, nor automatically shard the data across different workers. The provided `input_fn` is called once per worker, thus giving one dataset per worker. Then one batch from that dataset is fed to one replica on that worker, thereby consuming N batches for N replicas on 1 worker. In other words, the dataset returned by the `input_fn` should provide batches of size `PER_REPLICA_BATCH_SIZE`. And the global batch size for a step can be obtained as `PER_REPLICA_BATCH_SIZE * strategy.num_replicas_in_sync`. When doing multi worker training, users will also want to either split their data across the workers, or shuffle with a random seed on each. You can see an example of how to do this in the [Multi-worker Training with Estimator](../tutorials/distribute/multi_worker_with_estimator.ipynb)."
