You no longer have to worry about creating the computational graph or sessions since Estimators handle all the \"plumbing\" for you. Furthermore, pre-made Estimators let you experiment with different model architectures by making only minimal code changes.  `tf.estimator.DNNClassifier`, for example, is a pre-made Estimator class that trains classification models based on dense, feed-forward neural networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Structure of a pre-made Estimators program\n",
        "\n",
        "A TensorFlow program relying on a pre-made Estimator typically consists of the following four steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. Write one or more dataset importing functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, you might create one function to import the training set and another function to import the test set. Each dataset importing function must return two objects:\n",
        "\n",
        "* a dictionary in which the keys are feature names and the values are Tensors (or SparseTensors) containing the corresponding feature data\n",
        "* a Tensor containing one or more labels\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, the following code illustrates the basic skeleton for an input function:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "def input_fn(dataset):\n",
        "    ...  # manipulate dataset, extracting the feature dict and the label\n",
        "    return feature_dict, label\n",

        "\n",
        "See [data guide](../../guide/data.md) for details.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Define the feature columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each `tf.feature_column` identifies a feature name, its type, and any input pre-processing. For example, the following snippet creates three feature columns that hold integer or floating-point data. The first two feature columns simply identify the feature's name and type. The third feature column also specifies a lambda the program will invoke to scale the raw data:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "# Define three numeric feature columns.\n",
        "population = tf.feature_column.numeric_column('population')\n",

        "  normalizer_fn=lambda x: x - global_education_mean)\n",

        "\n",

        "# Instantiate an estimator, passing the feature columns.\n",
        "estimator = tf.estimator.LinearClassifier(\n",
        "  feature_columns=[population, crime_rate, median_education])\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. Call a training, evaluation, or inference method.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, all Estimators provide a `train` method, which trains a model.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "# `input_fn` is the function created in Step 1\n",
        "estimator.train(input_fn=my_training_set, steps=2000)\n",
