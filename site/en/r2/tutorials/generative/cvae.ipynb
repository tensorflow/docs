In this example, we simply model this distribution as a diagonal Gaussian. In this case, the inference network outputs the mean and log-variance parameters of a factorized Gaussian (log-variance instead of the variance directly is for numerical stability).\n",

In the generative network, we mirror this architecture by using a fully-connected layer followed by three convolution transpose layers (a.k.a. deconvolutional layers in some contexts). Note, it's common practice to avoid using batch normalization when training VAEs, since the additional stochasticity due to using mini-batches may aggravate instability on top of the stochasticity from sampling."
