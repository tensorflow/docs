        "In this tutorial, you will train a sentiment analysis model using DTensors. The example demonstrates three distributed training schemes:\n",

        " - Data Parallel training, where the training samples are sharded (partitioned) to devices.\n",
        " - Model Parallel training, where the model variables are sharded to devices.\n",
        " - Spatial Parallel training, where the features of input data are  sharded to devices (also known as [Spatial Partitioning](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/train-ml-models-on-large-images-and-3d-volumes-with-spatial-partitioning-on-cloud-tpus)).\n",

        "- Then, building an MLP model with custom Dense and BatchNorm layers using a `tf.Module` to track the inference variables. The model constructor will take additional `Layout` arguments to control the sharding of variables.\n",
        "- For training, you will first use data parallel training together with `tf.experimental.dtensor`'s checkpoint feature. Then, you will continue with Model Parallel Training and Spatial Parallel Training.\n",
