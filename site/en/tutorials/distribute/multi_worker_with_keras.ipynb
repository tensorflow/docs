In multi-worker training with `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`, there is usually one `worker` that takes on a little more responsibility like saving checkpoint and writing summary file for TensorBoard in addition to what a regular `worker` does. Such worker is referred to as the `chief` worker, and it is customary that the `worker` with `index` 0 is appointed as the chief `worker` (in fact this is how `tf.distribute.Strategy` is implemented). `task` on the other hand provides information of the current task. The first component `cluster` is the same for all workers, and the second component `task` is different on each worker and specifies the `type` and `index` of that worker. \n",

If you have a finite dataset, setting `steps_per_epoch` is optional. In particular, if the sharding is not balanced (for example, this could happen if you have a file-based dataset with the number of files more than the number of workers and some workers get files that contain more data than others. You can shard the data more evenly by manually setting `tf.data.experimental.AutoShardPolicy`, more details [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/input#sharding)), and `steps_per_epoch` is not set or set to be greater than the size of the smallest shard divided by the per-worker batch size, you might get partial batches towards the end of training."

The best choice of collective implementation depends upon the number and kind of GPUs, and the network interconnect in the cluster.

The temporary directories on the worker need to be unique to prevent errors resulting from multiple workers trying to write to the same location.
