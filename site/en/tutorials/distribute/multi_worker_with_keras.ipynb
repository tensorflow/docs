In multi-worker training, there is usually one `worker` that takes on a little more responsibility like saving checkpoint and writing summary file for TensorBoard in addition to what a regular `worker` does. Such worker is referred to as the 'chief' worker, and it is customary that the `worker` with `index` 0 is appointed as the chief `worker` (in fact this is how `tf.distribute.Strategy` is implemented). `task` on the other hand provides information of the current task. The first component `cluster` is the same for all workers, and the second component `task` is different on each worker and specifies the `type` and `index` of that worker. \n",

This means the machine that has such setting is the first worker, which will be appointed as the chief worker and do more work than other workers. Note that other machines will need to have `TF_CONFIG` environment variable set as well, and it should have the same `cluster` dict, but different task `type` or task `index` depending on what the roles of those machines are.\n",

        "With the integration of `tf.distribute.Strategy` API into `tf.keras`, the only change you will make to distribute the training to multi-worker is enclosing the model building and `model.compile()` call inside `strategy.scope()`. The distribution strategy's scope dictates how and where the variables are created, and in the case of `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`, the variables created are `MirroredVariable`s, and they are replicated on each of the workers.\n",

        "Note: Currently there is a limitation in `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` where TensorFlow ops need to be created after the instance of strategy is created. If you see `RuntimeError: Collective ops must be configured at program startup`, try creating the instance of `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` at the beginning of the program and put the code that may create ops after the strategy is instantiated.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: In this Colab, the following code can run with expected result, but however this is effectively single-worker training since `TF_CONFIG` is not set. Once you set `TF_CONFIG` in your own example, you should expect speed-up with training on multiple machines.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: Always pass in `steps_per_epoch` argument to `model.fit()` since `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` does not support last partial batch handling. When using `steps_per_epoch`, `model.fit()` does not create a new iterator from the input every epoch, but continues from wherever the last epoch ended. Hence, make sure to call `.repeat()` on the dataset so it has an adequate number of examples for N epochs. If your dataset is not a repeated dataset, the `steps_per_epoch` should be set based on the amount of training data on each worker so that all workers would perform the same number of steps of training or evaluation, which is required by allreduce. In particular, if the sharding is not balanced, `steps_per_epoch` should be set to the size of the smallest sharded devided by the per-worker batch size."

The best choice of collective implementation depends upon the number and kind of GPUs, and the network interconnect in the cluster.
