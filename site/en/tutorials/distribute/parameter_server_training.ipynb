        "The dataset in the above code is created using the `ClusterCoordinator.create_per_worker_dataset` API). It creates one dataset per worker and returns a container object. You can call the `iter` method on it to create a per-worker iterator. The per-worker iterator contains one iterator per worker and the corresponding slice of a worker will be substituted in the input argument of the function passed to the `ClusterCoordinator.schedule` method before the function is executed on a particular worker.\n",

        "Currently, the `ClusterCoordinator.schedule` method assumes workers are equivalent and thus assumes the datasets on different workers are the same except they may be shuffled differently if they contain a `Dataset.shuffle` operation. Because of this, it is also recommended that the datasets to be repeated indefinitely and you schedule a finite number of steps instead of relying on the `OutOfRangeError` from a dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another important note is that `tf.data` datasets don’t support implicit serialization and deserialization across task boundaries. So it is important to create the whole dataset inside the function passed to `ClusterCoordinator.create_per_worker_dataset`."

You should convert those calls into epoch-level calls with suitably picked `steps_per_epoch`, so that they are called every `steps_per_epoch` number of steps. Built-in callbacks are not affected: their batch-level calls have been modified to be performant. Supporting batch-level calls for `ParameterServerStrategy` is being planned.\n",
