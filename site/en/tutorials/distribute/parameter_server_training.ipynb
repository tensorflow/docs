You can call the `iter` method on it to create a per-worker iterator. The per-worker iterator contains one iterator per worker and the corresponding slice of a worker will be substituted in the input argument of the function passed to the `ClusterCoordinator.schedule` method before the function is executed on a particular worker.\n",

Because of this, it is also recommended to repeat datasets, and schedule a finite number of steps instead of relying on receiving an `OutOfRangeError` from a dataset.\n",
