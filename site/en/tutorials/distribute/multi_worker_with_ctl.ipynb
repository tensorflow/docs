The training loop is distributed via `tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`, such that a `tf.keras` model—designed to run on [single-worker](custom_training.ipynb)—can seamlessly work on multiple workers with minimal code changes. Custom training loops provide flexibility and a greater control on training, while also making it easier to debug the model.
