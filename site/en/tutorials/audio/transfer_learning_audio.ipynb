It can use an audio waveform as input and make independent predictions for each of the 521 audio events from the [AudioSet](http://g.co/audioset) corpus.\n",
        "\n",
        "Internally, the model extracts \"frames\" from the audio signal and processes batches of these frames. This version of the model uses frames that are 0.96 second long and extracts one frame every 0.48 seconds .\n",

        "The model accepts a 1-D float32 Tensor or NumPy array containing a waveform of arbitrary length, represented as single-channel (mono) 16 kHz samples in the range `[-1.0, +1.0]`. This tutorial contains code to help you convert WAV files into the supported format.\n",

Then, you will train the network on a small amount of data for audio classification _without_ requiring a lot of labeled data and training end-to-end. (This is similar to [transfer learning for image classification with TensorFlow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning_with_hub) for more information.)\n",
