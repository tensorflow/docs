A 3D CNN uses a three-dimensional filter to perform convolutions. The kernel is able to slide in three directions, whereas in a 2D CNN it can slide in two dimensions. The model is based on the work published in [A Closer Look at Spatiotemporal Convolutions for Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11248v3) by D. Tran et al. (2017).  In this tutorial, you will:\n",

Tran et al. (2017). The paper compares several versions of 3D ResNets. Instead of operating on a single image with dimensions `(height, width)`, like standard ResNets, these operate on video volume `(time, height, width)`. The most obvious approach to this problem would be replace each 2D convolution (`layers.Conv2D`) with a 3D convolution (`layers.Conv3D`).\n",

The (2 + 1)D convolution allows for the decomposition of the spatial and temporal dimensions, therefore creating two separate steps. An advantage of this approach is that factorizing the convolutions into spatial and temporal dimensions saves parameters. \n",

So a 3D convolution layer with a kernel size of `(3 x 3 x 3)` would need a weight-matrix with `27 * channels ** 2` entries. The reference paper found that a more effective & efficient approach was to factorize the convolution. Instead of a single 3D convolution to process the time and space dimensions, they proposed a \\\"(2+1)D\\\" convolution which processes the space and time dimensions separately. The figure below shows the factored spatial and temporal convolutions of a (2 + 1)D convolution.\n",

In the (2 + 1)D convolution the spatial convolution takes in data of the shape `(1, width, height)`, while the temporal convolution takes in data of the shape `(time, 1, 1)`. For example, a (2 + 1)D convolution with kernel size `(3 x 3 x 3)` would need weight matrices of size `(9 * channels**2) + (3 * channels**2)`, less than half as many as the full 3D convolution. This tutorial implements (2 + 1)D ResNet18, where each convolution in the resnet is replaced by a (2+1)D convolution."
