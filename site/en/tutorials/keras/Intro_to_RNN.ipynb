With such models, a sequence input, such as an entire movie review on IMDB, needs to be transformed into a single data point, and processed in one go.\n",

Taking IMDB movie review as an example, RNN processes each review word by word.  When processing a word, the RNN network \"remembers\" the state of all the previous words in this review.  The state of the RNN is reset when processing another independent input, such as another review."

    "As a reminder, in [basic text classification tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_text_classification) , our fairly naive approach to this very dataset got us to 88% test accuracy. Unfortunately, our small recurrent network doesn't perform very well at all compared to this baseline (only up to 85% validation accuracy, and 74% test accuracy). Part of the problem is that our inputs only consider the first 500 words rather the full sequences -- hence our RNN has access to less information than our earlier baseline model. The remainder of the problem is simply that SimpleRNN isn't very good at processing long sequences, like text. Other types of recurrent layers perform much better. Let's take a look at some more advanced layers. "
