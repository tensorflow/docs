# Publishing process

## Terms of service

By submitting a model for publication, you agree to the TensorFlow Hub Terms of
Service at [https://tfhub.dev/terms](https://tfhub.dev/terms).

## Overview of the publishing process

The full process of publishing consists of:

1.  Exporting the model asset to publish (see how to
    [export a model](exporting_tf2_saved_model.md))
1.  Writing publisher page and model documentation (see how to
    [write documentation](writing_documentation.md))
1.  Sending a pull request for review (see how to
    [contribute](contribute_a_model.md))

Important: You are encouraged to send a small PR (e.g. fixing a typo in the
repo) or a PR with only your publisher page as your first contribution before
sending a PR publishing a model.
