Just replace the `\"https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_050_128/feature_vector/2\"` handle in the `hub.Module()` call with a handle of different module and rerun all the code. You can see all available image modules at [tfhub.dev](https://tfhub.dev/s?module-type=image-feature-vector). \n",

Many of the modules -- including the MobileNet modules -- were trained on the [ImageNet dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/imagenet2012) which contains over 1 million images and 1000 classes. Choosing a network architecture provides a tradeoff between speed and classification accuracy: models like MobileNet or NASNet Mobile are fast and small, more traditional architectures like Inception and ResNet were designed for accuracy.\n",
