# Mailing lists

As a community, we do much of our collaboration on public mailing lists. Please
note that if you're looking for help using TensorFlow,
[TensorFlow Forum](https://discuss.tensorflow.org/),
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow), and
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues) are the best
initial places to look. To receive a roundup of updates from the TensorFlow team each quarter, subscribe to the [TensorFlow newsletter](https://services.google.com/fb/forms/tensorflow/).

## Special Interest Groups

TensorFlow's
[Special Interest Groups](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/tree/master/sigs) (SIGs)
support community collaboration on particular project focuses. Members of these
groups work together to build and support TensorFlow related projects. While their
archives are public, different SIGs have their own membership policies.

*   [addons](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/forum/addons) -
    Supporting SIG Addons, for extensions to TensorFlow that confirm to the
    stable API.
*   [build](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/forum/build) -
    Supporting SIG Build, for build, distribution and packaging of TensorFlow.
*   [io](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/forum/io) - Supporting SIG
    IO, for file systems and formats not available in core TensorFlow.
*   [jvm](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/forum/jvm) - Supporting
    SIG JVM, building Java and JVM support for TensorFlow.
