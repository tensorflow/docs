TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers from the Google
Brain team within [Google's AI organization](https://ai.google/). Google open
sourced TensorFlow in the hope of sharing technology with the external community
and encouraging collaboration between researchers and industry. Since then,
TensorFlow has grown into a thriving ecosystem of products, on a wide range of
platforms. But our goal is still to make machine learning accessible to anyone,
anywhere.
