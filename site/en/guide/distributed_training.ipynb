        "## Using `tf.distribute.Strategy` with Estimator (Limited support)\n",
        "`tf.estimator` is a distributed training TensorFlow API that originally supported the async parameter server approach. Like with Keras, we've integrated `tf.distribute.Strategy` into `tf.Estimator`. If you're using Estimator for your training, you can easily change to distributed training with very few changes to your code. With this, Estimator users can now do synchronous distributed training on multiple GPUs and multiple workers, as well as use TPUs. This support in Estimator is, however, limited. See [What's supported now](#estimator_support) section below for more details.\n",
        "\n",
        "The usage of `tf.distribute.Strategy` with Estimator is slightly different than the Keras case. Instead of using `strategy.scope`, now we pass the strategy object into the [`RunConfig`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/estimator/RunConfig) for the Estimator.\n",

In Estimator, however, we do not do automatic splitting of batch, nor automatically shard the data across different workers. You have full control over how you want your data to be distributed across workers and devices, and you must provide an `input_fn` to specify how to distribute your data.\n",
