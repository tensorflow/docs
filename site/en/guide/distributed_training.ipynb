Like with Keras, we've integrated `tf.distribute.Strategy` into `tf.Estimator`. If you're using Estimator for your training, you can easily change to distributed training with very few changes to your code. With this, Estimator users can now do synchronous distributed training on multiple GPUs and multiple workers, as well as use TPUs. This support in Estimator is, however, limited. See [What's supported now](#estimator_support) section below for more details.\n",
