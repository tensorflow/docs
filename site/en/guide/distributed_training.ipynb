        "\n",
        "* Easy to use and support multiple user segments, including researchers, machine learning engineers, etc.\n",
        "* Provide good performance out of the box.\n",
        "* Easy switching between strategies.\n",

Although training is the focus of this guide, this API can also be used for distributing evaluation and prediction on different platforms.\n",

In sync training, all workers train over different slices of input data in sync, and aggregating gradients at each step.

Typically sync training is supported via all-reduce and async through parameter server architecture.\n",

        "If you need more flexibility and control over your training loops than is possible with Estimator or Keras, you can write custom training loops. For instance, when using a GAN, you may want to take a different number of generator or discriminator steps each round. Similarly, the high level frameworks are not very suitable for Reinforcement Learning training.\n",

        "1. You used `tf.nn.compute_average_loss` to compute the loss. `tf.nn.compute_average_loss` sums the per example loss and divides the sum by the `global_batch_size`. This is important because later after the gradients are calculated on each replica, they are aggregated across the replicas by **summing** them. That's why you need to configure `sum` as a `distribute_reduction_method` in the model for the metrics to be correct.\n",
        "2. You also used the `tf.distribute.Strategy.reduce` API to aggregate the results returned by `tf.distribute.Strategy.run`. `tf.distribute.Strategy.run` returns results from each local replica in the strategy, and there are multiple ways to consume this result. You can `reduce` them to get an aggregated value. You can also do `tf.distribute.Strategy.experimental_local_results` to get the list of values contained in the result, one per local replica.\n",
        "3. When you call `apply_gradients` within a distribution strategy scope, its behavior is modified. Specifically, before applying gradients on each parallel instance during synchronous training, it performs a sum-over-all-replicas of the gradients.\n"
