        "`tf.distribute.Strategy` is a TensorFlow API to distribute training across multiple GPUs, multiple machines, or TPUs. Using this API, you can distribute your existing models and training code with minimal code changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "`tf.distribute.Strategy` has been designed with these key goals in mind:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Easy to use and support multiple user segments, including researchers, machine learning engineers, etc.\n",
        "* Provide good performance out of the box.\n",
        "* Easy switching between strategies.\n",

Although training is the focus of this guide, this API can also be used for distributing evaluation and prediction on different platforms.\n",

        "Note: For a deeper understanding of the concepts, watch the deep-dive presentation—[Inside TensorFlow: `tf.distribute.Strategy`](https://youtu.be/jKV53r9-H14). This is especially recommended if you plan to write your own training loop.\n"

In sync training, all workers train over different slices of input data in sync, and aggregating gradients at each step.

Typically sync training is supported via all-reduce and async through parameter server architecture.\n",

The `'TF_CONFIG'` environment variable is a JSON string which specifies what tasks constitute a cluster, their addresses and each task's role in the cluster. The [`tensorflow/ecosystem`](https://github.com/tensorflow/ecosystem) repo provides a Kubernetes template, which sets up `'TF_CONFIG'` for your training tasks.\n",

In multi-worker training, there is usually one worker that takes on a little more responsibility like saving checkpoint and writing summary file for TensorBoard in addition to what a regular worker does. Such worker is referred to as the \"chief\" worker, and it is customary that the worker with index `0` is appointed as the chief worker (in fact this is how `tf.distribute.Strategy` is implemented).\n",
