This means TensorFlow operations are executed by Python, operation by operation, and returning results back to Python. Eager TensorFlow takes advantage of GPUs, allowing you to place variables, tensors, and even operations on GPUs and TPUs.  It is also easy to debug.\n",

        "**Graphs are data structures that contain a set of `tf.Operation` objects, which represent units of computation; and `tf.Tensor` objects, which represent the units of data that flow between operations.** They are defined in a `tf.Graph` context. Since these graphs are data structures, they can be saved, run, and restored all without the original Python code.\n",
