For instance, Python supports polymorphism, but `tf.Graph` requires its inputs to have a specified data type and dimension. Or you may perform side tasks like reading command-line arguments, raising an error, or working with a more complex Python object; none of these things can run in a `tf.Graph`.\n",

For example, `TensorShape([1, 2])` is a subtype of `TensorShape([None, None])` and so a call to the tf.function with `TensorShape([1, 2])` can be dispatched to the `ConcreteFunction` produced with `TensorShape([None, None])` but if a `ConcreteFunction` with `TensorShape([1, None])` also exists then it will prioritized since it is more specific.\n",

        "* For `Variable`, the type is similar to `Tensor`, but also includes a unique resource ID of the variable, necessary to correctly wire control dependencies\n",

For example, the type of `{1: 2, 3: 4}`, is `MappingTraceType<<KeyValue<1, LiteralTraceType<2>>>, <KeyValue<3, LiteralTraceType<4>>>>`. However, unlike ordered containers, `{1: 2, 3: 4}` and `{3: 4, 1: 2}` have equivalent types.\n",
        "* For Python objects which implement the `__tf_tracing_type__` method, the type is whatever that method returns\n",
        "* For any other Python objects, the type is a generic `TraceType` which uses the object's Python equality and hashing for matching.

However because it is a python integer and not a TensorFlow object, it's value is captured during the first trace. When the `tf.function` is used, the `assign_add` will be recorded unconditionally in the underlying graph. Therefore `v` will increase by 1, every time the `tf.function` is called. This issue is common among users that try to migrate their Grpah-mode Tensorflow code to Tensorflow 2 using `tf.function` decorators, when python side-effects (the `counter` in the example) are used to determine what ops to run (`assign_add` in the example). Usually, users realize this only after seeing suspicious numerical results, or significantly lower performance than expected (e.g. if the guarded operation is very costly)."
