        "\n",
        "1. **Unit Test**: Ensure that the code you’re upgrading has a unit test suite with reasonable coverage. This is Python code, so the language won’t protect you from many classes of mistakes. Also ensure that any dependency you have has already been upgraded to be compatible with TensorFlow 2.0.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Install TensorFlow 1.14**: Upgrade your TensorFlow to the latest TensorFlow 1.x version, at least 1.14. This includes the final TensorFlow 2.0 API in `tf.compat.v2`.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Test With 1.14**: Ensure your unit tests pass at this point. You’ll be running them repeatedly as you upgrade so starting from green is important.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Run the upgrade script**: Run `tf_upgrade_v2` on your entire source tree, tests included. This will upgrade your code to a format where it only uses symbols available in TensorFlow 2.0. Deprecated symbols will be accessed with `tf.compat.v1`. These will eventually require manual attention, but not immediately.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Run the converted tests with TensorFlow 1.14**: Your code should still run fine in TensorFlow 1.14. Run your unit tests again. Any error in your tests here means there’s a bug in the upgrade script. [Please let us know](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues).\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Check the upgrade report for warnings and errors**: The script writes a report file that explains any conversions you should double-check, or any manual action you need to take. For example: Any remaining instances of contrib will require manual action to remove. Please consult [the RFC for more instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20180907-contrib-sunset.md). \n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Install TensorFlow 2.0**: At this point it should be safe to switch to TensorFlow 2.0\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Test with `v1.disable_v2_behavior`**: Re-running your tests with al `v1.disable_v2_behavior()` in the tests main function should give the same results as running under 1.14.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Enable V2 Behavior**: Now that your tests work using the v2 API, you can start looking into turning on v2 behavior. Depending on how your code is written this may require some changes. See the [Migration guide](migrate.ipynb) for details."
