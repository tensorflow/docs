        "Mixed precision is the use of both 16-bit and 32-bit floating-point types in a model during training to make it run faster and use less memory. By keeping certain parts of the model in the 32-bit types for numeric stability, the model will have a lower step time and train equally as well in terms of the evaluation metrics such as accuracy. This guide describes how to use the Keras mixed precision API to speed up your models. Using this API can improve performance by more than 3 times on modern GPUs and 60% on TPUs."

Modern accelerators can run operations faster in the 16-bit dtypes, as they have specialized hardware to run 16-bit computations and 16-bit dtypes can be read from memory faster.\n",

Therefore, these lower-precision dtypes should be used whenever possible on those devices. However, variables and a few computations should still be in float32 for numeric reasons so that the model trains to the same quality. The Keras mixed precision API allows you to use a mix of either float16 or bfloat16 with float32, to get the performance benefits from float16/bfloat16 and the numeric stability benefits from float32.\n",

This will cause the gradients to scale by $1024$ as well, greatly reducing the chance of underflow. Once the final gradients are computed, divide them by $1024$ to bring them back to their correct values.\n",
