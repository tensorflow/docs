# Module: tf.contrib.quantize



Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/quantize/__init__.py`](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.10/tensorflow/contrib/quantize/__init__.py).

Functions for rewriting graphs for quantized training.

## Functions

[`create_eval_graph(...)`](../../tf/contrib/quantize/create_eval_graph): Rewrites an eval input_graph in place for simulated quantization.

[`create_training_graph(...)`](../../tf/contrib/quantize/create_training_graph): Rewrites a training input_graph in place for simulated quantization.

[`experimental_create_eval_graph(...)`](../../tf/contrib/quantize/experimental_create_eval_graph): Rewrites an eval input_graph in place for simulated quantization.

[`experimental_create_training_graph(...)`](../../tf/contrib/quantize/experimental_create_training_graph): Rewrites a training input_graph in place for simulated quantization.
