# Module: tf.contrib.constrained_optimization



Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/constrained_optimization/__init__.py`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.13/tensorflow/contrib/constrained_optimization/__init__.py).

A library for performing constrained optimization in TensorFlow.

## Classes

[`class AdditiveExternalRegretOptimizer`](../../tf/contrib/constrained_optimization/AdditiveExternalRegretOptimizer): A `ConstrainedOptimizer` based on external-regret minimization.

[`class AdditiveSwapRegretOptimizer`](../../tf/contrib/constrained_optimization/AdditiveSwapRegretOptimizer): A `ConstrainedOptimizer` based on swap-regret minimization.

[`class ConstrainedMinimizationProblem`](../../tf/contrib/constrained_optimization/ConstrainedMinimizationProblem): Abstract class representing a `ConstrainedMinimizationProblem`.

[`class ConstrainedOptimizer`](../../tf/contrib/constrained_optimization/ConstrainedOptimizer): Base class representing a constrained optimizer.

[`class MultiplicativeSwapRegretOptimizer`](../../tf/contrib/constrained_optimization/MultiplicativeSwapRegretOptimizer): A `ConstrainedOptimizer` based on swap-regret minimization.

## Functions

[`find_best_candidate_distribution(...)`](../../tf/contrib/constrained_optimization/find_best_candidate_distribution): Finds a distribution minimizing an objective subject to constraints.

[`find_best_candidate_index(...)`](../../tf/contrib/constrained_optimization/find_best_candidate_index): Heuristically finds the best candidate solution to a constrained problem.
