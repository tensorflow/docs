# tf.contrib.distributions.Binomial

## Class `Binomial`

Binomial distribution.

Inherits From: [`Distribution`](../../../tf/distributions/Distribution)



Defined in [`contrib/distributions/python/ops/binomial.py`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r1.14/tensorflow/contrib/distributions/python/ops/binomial.py).

<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

This distribution is parameterized by `probs`, a (batch of) probabilities for
drawing a `1` and `total_count`, the number of trials per draw from the
Binomial.

#### Mathematical Details

The Binomial is a distribution over the number of `1`'s in `total_count`
independent trials, with each trial having the same probability of `1`, i.e.,
`probs`.

The probability mass function (pmf) is,

```none
pmf(k; n, p) = p**k (1 - p)**(n - k) / Z
Z = k! (n - k)! / n!
```

where:
* `total_count = n`,
* `probs = p`,
* `Z` is the normalizing constant, and,
* `n!` is the factorial of `n`.

#### Examples

Create a single distribution, corresponding to 5 coin flips.

```python
dist = Binomial(total_count=5., probs=.5)
```

Create a single distribution (using logits), corresponding to 5 coin flips.

```python
dist = Binomial(total_count=5., logits=0.)
```

Creates 3 distributions with the third distribution most likely to have
successes.

```python
p = [.2, .3, .8]
# n will be broadcast to [4., 4., 4.], to match p.
dist = Binomial(total_count=4., probs=p)
```

The distribution functions can be evaluated on counts.

```python
# counts same shape as p.
counts = [1., 2, 3]
dist.prob(counts)  # Shape [3]

# p will be broadcast to [[.2, .3, .8], [.2, .3, .8]] to match counts.
counts = [[1., 2, 1], [2, 2, 4]]
dist.prob(counts)  # Shape [2, 3]

# p will be broadcast to shape [5, 7, 3] to match counts.
counts = [[...]]  # Shape [5, 7, 3]
dist.prob(counts)  # Shape [5, 7, 3]
```

Instructions for updating:
The TensorFlow Distributions library has moved to TensorFlow Probability (https://github.com/tensorflow/probability). You should update all references to use `tfp.distributions` instead of <a href="../../../tf/contrib/distributions"><code>tf.contrib.distributions</code></a>.

#### Args:


* <b>`total_count`</b>: Non-negative floating point tensor with shape broadcastable
  to `[N1,..., Nm]` with `m >= 0` and the same dtype as `probs` or
  `logits`. Defines this as a batch of `N1 x ...  x Nm` different Binomial
  distributions. Its components should be equal to integer values.
* <b>`logits`</b>: Floating point tensor representing the log-odds of a
  positive event with shape broadcastable to `[N1,..., Nm]` `m >= 0`, and
  the same dtype as `total_count`. Each entry represents logits for the
  probability of success for independent Binomial distributions. Only one
  of `logits` or `probs` should be passed in.
* <b>`probs`</b>: Positive floating point tensor with shape broadcastable to
  `[N1,..., Nm]` `m >= 0`, `probs in [0, 1]`. Each entry represents the
  probability of success for independent Binomial distributions. Only one
  of `logits` or `probs` should be passed in.
* <b>`validate_args`</b>: Python `bool`, default `False`. When `True` distribution
  parameters are checked for validity despite possibly degrading runtime
  performance. When `False` invalid inputs may silently render incorrect
  outputs.
* <b>`allow_nan_stats`</b>: Python `bool`, default `True`. When `True`, statistics
  (e.g., mean, mode, variance) use the value "`NaN`" to indicate the
  result is undefined. When `False`, an exception is raised if one or
  more of the statistic's batch members are undefined.
* <b>`name`</b>: Python `str` name prefixed to Ops created by this class.



## Properties

<h3 id="allow_nan_stats"><code>allow_nan_stats</code></h3>

Python `bool` describing behavior when a stat is undefined.

Stats return +/- infinity when it makes sense. E.g., the variance of a
Cauchy distribution is infinity. However, sometimes the statistic is
undefined, e.g., if a distribution's pdf does not achieve a maximum within
the support of the distribution, the mode is undefined. If the mean is
undefined, then by definition the variance is undefined. E.g. the mean for
Student's T for df = 1 is undefined (no clear way to say it is either + or -
infinity), so the variance = E[(X - mean)**2] is also undefined.

#### Returns:


* <b>`allow_nan_stats`</b>: Python `bool`.

<h3 id="covariance"><code>covariance</code></h3>

``` python
covariance(name='covariance')
```

Covariance.

Covariance is (possibly) defined only for non-scalar-event distributions.

For example, for a length-`k`, vector-valued distribution, it is calculated
as,

```none
Cov[i, j] = Covariance(X_i, X_j) = E[(X_i - E[X_i]) (X_j - E[X_j])]
```

where `Cov` is a (batch of) `k x k` matrix, `0 <= (i, j) < k`, and `E`
denotes expectation.

Alternatively, for non-vector, multivariate distributions (e.g.,
matrix-valued, Wishart), `Covariance` shall return a (batch of) matrices
under some vectorization of the events, i.e.,

```none
Cov[i, j] = Covariance(Vec(X)_i, Vec(X)_j) = [as above]
```

where `Cov` is a (batch of) `k' x k'` matrices,
`0 <= (i, j) < k' = reduce_prod(event_shape)`, and `Vec` is some function
mapping indices of this distribution's event dimensions to indices of a
length-`k'` vector.

<h3 id="kl_divergence"><code>kl_divergence</code></h3>

``` python
kl_divergence(
    other,
    name='kl_divergence'
)
```

Computes the Kullback--Leibler divergence.

Denote this distribution (`self`) by `p` and the `other` distribution by
`q`. Assuming `p, q` are absolutely continuous with respect to reference
measure `r`, the KL divergence is defined as:

```none
KL[p, q] = E_p[log(p(X)/q(X))]
         = -int_F p(x) log q(x) dr(x) + int_F p(x) log p(x) dr(x)
         = H[p, q] - H[p]
```

  divergence.

<h3 id="log_cdf"><code>log_cdf</code></h3>

``` python
log_cdf(
    value,
    name='log_cdf'
)
```

Log cumulative distribution function.

Given random variable `X`, the cumulative distribution function `cdf` is:

```none
log_cdf(x) := Log[ P[X <= x] ]
```

Often, a numerical approximation can be used for `log_cdf(x)` that yields
a more accurate answer than simply taking the logarithm of the `cdf` when
`x << -1`.

    value,
    name='log_prob'
)
```

Additional documentation from `Binomial`:

For each batch member of counts `value`, `P[value]` is the probability that
after sampling `self.total_count` draws from this Binomial distribution, the
number of successes is `value`. Since different sequences of draws can result in
the same counts, the probability includes a combinatorial coefficient.

Note: `value` must be a non-negative tensor with dtype `dtype` and whose shape
can be broadcast with `self.probs` and `self.total_count`. `value` is only legal
if it is less than or equal to `self.total_count` and its components are equal
to integer values.

#### Args:


* <b>`value`</b>: `float` or `double` `Tensor`.
* <b>`name`</b>: Python `str` prepended to names of ops created by this function.


#### Returns:


* <b>`log_prob`</b>: a `Tensor` of shape `sample_shape(x) + self.batch_shape` with
  values of type `self.dtype`.

<h3 id="log_survival_function"><code>log_survival_function</code></h3>

``` python
log_survival_function(
    value,
    name='log_survival_function'
)
```

Log survival function.

Given random variable `X`, the survival function is defined:

```none
log_survival_function(x) = Log[ P[X > x] ]
                         = Log[ 1 - P[X <= x] ]
                         = Log[ 1 - cdf(x) ]
```

Typically, different numerical approximations can be used for the log
survival function, which are more accurate than `1 - cdf(x)` when `x >> 1`.

#### Args:


* <b>`value`</b>: `float` or `double` `Tensor`.
* <b>`name`</b>: Python `str` prepended to names of ops created by this function.

<h3 id="mode"><code>mode</code></h3>

``` python
mode(name='mode')
```

Additional documentation from `Binomial`:

Note that when `(1 + total_count) * probs` is an integer, there are
actually two modes. Namely, `(1 + total_count) * probs` and
`(1 + total_count) * probs - 1` are both modes. Here we return only the
larger of the two modes.

```

param_shapes with static (i.e. `TensorShape`) shapes.

This is a class method that describes what key/value arguments are required
to instantiate the given `Distribution` so that a particular shape is
returned for that instance's call to `sample()`. Assumes that the sample's
shape is known statically.

Subclasses should override class method `_param_shapes` to return
constant-valued tensors when constant values are fed.

#### Args:
