# tf.contrib.distributions.RelaxedBernoulli

## Class `RelaxedBernoulli`

Inherits From: [`TransformedDistribution`](../../../tf/contrib/distributions/TransformedDistribution)



Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/distributions/python/ops/relaxed_bernoulli.py`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.12/tensorflow/contrib/distributions/python/ops/relaxed_bernoulli.py).

RelaxedBernoulli distribution with temperature and logits parameters.

The RelaxedBernoulli is a distribution over the unit interval (0,1), which
continuously approximates a Bernoulli. The degree of approximation is
controlled by a temperature: as the temperature goes to 0 the
RelaxedBernoulli becomes discrete with a distribution described by the
`logits` or `probs` parameters, as the temperature goes to infinity the
RelaxedBernoulli becomes the constant distribution that is identically 0.5.

The RelaxedBernoulli distribution is a reparameterized continuous
distribution that is the binary special case of the RelaxedOneHotCategorical
distribution (Maddison et al., 2016; Jang et al., 2016). For details on the
binary special case see the appendix of Maddison et al. (2016) where it is
referred to as BinConcrete. If you use this distribution, please cite both
papers.

Some care needs to be taken for loss functions that depend on the
log-probability of RelaxedBernoullis, because computing log-probabilities of
the RelaxedBernoulli can suffer from underflow issues. In many case loss
functions such as these are invariant under invertible transformations of
the random variables. The KL divergence, found in the variational autoencoder
loss, is an example. Because RelaxedBernoullis are sampled by a Logistic
random variable followed by a <a href="../../../tf/math/sigmoid"><code>tf.sigmoid</code></a> op, one solution is to treat
the Logistic as the random variable and <a href="../../../tf/math/sigmoid"><code>tf.sigmoid</code></a> as downstream. The
KL divergences of two Logistics, which are always followed by a <a href="../../../tf/math/sigmoid"><code>tf.sigmoid</code></a>
op, is equivalent to evaluating KL divergences of RelaxedBernoulli samples.
See Maddison et al., 2016 for more details where this distribution is called
the BinConcrete.

An alternative approach is to evaluate Bernoulli log probability or KL
directly on relaxed samples, as done in Jang et al., 2016. In this case,
guarantees on the loss are usually violated. For instance, using a Bernoulli
KL in a relaxed ELBO is no longer a lower bound on the log marginal
probability of the observation. Thus care and early stopping are important.

#### Examples

Creates three continuous distributions, which approximate 3 Bernoullis with
probabilities (0.1, 0.5, 0.4). Samples from these distributions will be in
the unit interval (0,1).

```python
temperature = 0.5
p = [0.1, 0.5, 0.4]
dist = RelaxedBernoulli(temperature, probs=p)
```

Creates three continuous distributions, which approximate 3 Bernoullis with
logits (-2, 2, 0). Samples from these distributions will be in
the unit interval (0,1).

```python
temperature = 0.5
logits = [-2, 2, 0]
dist = RelaxedBernoulli(temperature, logits=logits)
```

Creates three continuous distributions, whose sigmoid approximate 3 Bernoullis
with logits (-2, 2, 0).

```python
temperature = 0.5
logits = [-2, 2, 0]
dist = Logistic(logits/temperature, 1./temperature)
samples = dist.sample()
sigmoid_samples = tf.sigmoid(samples)
# sigmoid_samples has the same distribution as samples from
# RelaxedBernoulli(temperature, logits=logits)
```

Creates three continuous distributions, which approximate 3 Bernoullis with
logits (-2, 2, 0). Samples from these distributions will be in
the unit interval (0,1). Because the temperature is very low, samples from
these distributions are almost discrete, usually taking values very close to 0
or 1.

```python
temperature = 1e-5
logits = [-2, 2, 0]
dist = RelaxedBernoulli(temperature, logits=logits)
```

Creates three continuous distributions, which approximate 3 Bernoullis with
logits (-2, 2, 0). Samples from these distributions will be in
the unit interval (0,1). Because the temperature is very high, samples from
these distributions are usually close to the (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) vector.

```python
temperature = 100
logits = [-2, 2, 0]
dist = RelaxedBernoulli(temperature, logits=logits)
```

Construct RelaxedBernoulli distributions. (deprecated)

THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed after 2018-10-01.
Instructions for updating:
The TensorFlow Distributions library has moved to TensorFlow Probability (https://github.com/tensorflow/probability). You should update all references to use `tfp.distributions` instead of <a href="../../../tf/contrib/distributions"><code>tf.contrib.distributions</code></a>.

#### Args:

* <b>`temperature`</b>: An 0-D `Tensor`, representing the temperature
    of a set of RelaxedBernoulli distributions. The temperature should be
    positive.
* <b>`logits`</b>: An N-D `Tensor` representing the log-odds
    of a positive event. Each entry in the `Tensor` parametrizes
    an independent RelaxedBernoulli distribution where the probability of an
    event is sigmoid(logits). Only one of `logits` or `probs` should be
    passed in.
* <b>`probs`</b>: An N-D `Tensor` representing the probability of a positive event.
    Each entry in the `Tensor` parameterizes an independent Bernoulli
    distribution. Only one of `logits` or `probs` should be passed in.
* <b>`validate_args`</b>: Python `bool`, default `False`. When `True` distribution
    parameters are checked for validity despite possibly degrading runtime
    performance. When `False` invalid inputs may silently render incorrect
    outputs.
* <b>`allow_nan_stats`</b>: Python `bool`, default `True`. When `True`, statistics
    (e.g., mean, mode, variance) use the value "`NaN`" to indicate the
    result is undefined. When `False`, an exception is raised if one or
    more of the statistic's batch members are undefined.
* <b>`name`</b>: Python `str` name prefixed to Ops created by this class.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If both `probs` and `logits` are passed, or if neither.



## Properties

<h3 id="allow_nan_stats"><code>allow_nan_stats</code></h3>

Python `bool` describing behavior when a stat is undefined.

Stats return +/- infinity when it makes sense. E.g., the variance of a
Cauchy distribution is infinity. However, sometimes the statistic is
undefined, e.g., if a distribution's pdf does not achieve a maximum within
the support of the distribution, the mode is undefined. If the mean is
undefined, then by definition the variance is undefined. E.g. the mean for
Student's T for df = 1 is undefined (no clear way to say it is either + or -
infinity), so the variance = E[(X - mean)**2] is also undefined.

as,

```

where `Cov` is a (batch of) `k x k` matrix, `0 <= (i, j) < k`, and `E`
denotes expectation.

Alternatively, for non-vector, multivariate distributions (e.g.,
matrix-valued, Wishart), `Covariance` shall return a (batch of) matrices
under some vectorization of the events, i.e.,

```none
Cov[i, j] = Covariance(Vec(X)_i, Vec(X)_j) = [as above]
```

)
```

Computes the Kullback--Leibler divergence.

Denote this distribution (`self`) by `p` and the `other` distribution by
`q`. Assuming `p, q` are absolutely continuous with respect to reference
measure `r`, the KL divergence is defined as:

```none
KL[p, q] = E_p[log(p(X)/q(X))]
         = -int_F p(x) log q(x) dr(x) + int_F p(x) log p(x) dr(x)

Given random variable `X`, the cumulative distribution function `cdf` is:

```none
log_cdf(x) := Log[ P[X <= x] ]

                         = Log[ 1 - cdf(x) ]
```

Typically, different numerical approximations can be used for the log
survival function, which are more accurate than `1 - cdf(x)` when `x >> 1`.
