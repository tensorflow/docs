# tf.contrib.gan.RunTrainOpsHook

## Class `RunTrainOpsHook`

Inherits From: [`SessionRunHook`](../../../tf/train/SessionRunHook)



Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/gan/python/train.py`](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.9/tensorflow/contrib/gan/python/train.py).

A hook to run train ops a fixed number of times.

## Methods

<h3 id="__init__"><code>__init__</code></h3>

``` python
__init__(
    train_ops,
    train_steps
)
```

Run train ops a certain number of times.

#### Args:

* <b>`train_ops`</b>: A train op or iterable of train ops to run.
* <b>`train_steps`</b>: The number of times to run the op(s).

<h3 id="after_create_session"><code>after_create_session</code></h3>

``` python
after_create_session(
    session,
    coord
)
```

Called when new TensorFlow session is created.

This is called to signal the hooks that a new session has been created. This
has two essential differences with the situation in which `begin` is called:

* When this is called, the graph is finalized and ops can no longer be added
    to the graph.
* This method will also be called as a result of recovering a wrapped
    session, not only at the beginning of the overall session.

#### Args:

* <b>`session`</b>: A TensorFlow Session that has been created.
* <b>`coord`</b>: A Coordinator object which keeps track of all threads.

<h3 id="after_run"><code>after_run</code></h3>

``` python
after_run(
    run_context,
    run_values
)
```

Called after each call to run().

The `run_values` argument contains results of requested ops/tensors by
`before_run()`.

The `run_context` argument is the same one send to `before_run` call.
`run_context.request_stop()` can be called to stop the iteration.

If `session.run()` raises any exceptions then `after_run()` is not called.

#### Args:

* <b>`run_context`</b>: A `SessionRunContext` object.
* <b>`run_values`</b>: A SessionRunValues object.

<h3 id="before_run"><code>before_run</code></h3>

``` python
before_run(run_context)
```



<h3 id="begin"><code>begin</code></h3>

``` python
begin()
```

Called once before using the session.

When called, the default graph is the one that will be launched in the
session.  The hook can modify the graph by adding new operations to it.
After the `begin()` call the graph will be finalized and the other callbacks
can not modify the graph anymore. Second call of `begin()` on the same
graph, should not change the graph.

<h3 id="end"><code>end</code></h3>

``` python
end(session)
```

Called at the end of session.

The `session` argument can be used in case the hook wants to run final ops,
such as saving a last checkpoint.

If `session.run()` raises exception other than OutOfRangeError or
StopIteration then `end()` is not called.
Note the difference between `end()` and `after_run()` behavior when
`session.run()` raises OutOfRangeError or StopIteration. In that case
`end()` is called but `after_run()` is not called.

#### Args:

* <b>`session`</b>: A TensorFlow Session that will be soon closed.
