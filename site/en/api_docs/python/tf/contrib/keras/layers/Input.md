### `tf.contrib.keras.layers.Input`

``` python
Input(
    shape=None,
    batch_shape=None,
    name=None,
    dtype=K.floatx(),
    sparse=False,
    tensor=None
)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/keras/python/keras/engine/topology.py`](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.2/tensorflow/contrib/keras/python/keras/engine/topology.py).

`Input()` is used to instantiate a Keras tensor.

A Keras tensor is a tensor object from the underlying backend
(Theano or TensorFlow), which we augment with certain
attributes that allow us to build a Keras model
just by knowing the inputs and outputs of the model.

For instance, if a, b and c and Keras tensors,
it becomes possible to do:
`model = Model(input=[a, b], output=c)`

The added Keras attribute is:
    `_keras_history`: Last layer applied to the tensor.
        the entire layer graph is retrievable from that layer,
        recursively.

#### Arguments:

    shape: A shape tuple (integer), not including the batch size.
        For instance, `shape=(32,)` indicates that the expected input
        will be batches of 32-dimensional vectors.
    batch_shape: A shape tuple (integer), including the batch size.
        For instance, `batch_shape=(10, 32)` indicates that
        the expected input will be batches of 10 32-dimensional vectors.
        `batch_shape=(None, 32)` indicates batches of an arbitrary number
        of 32-dimensional vectors.
    name: An optional name string for the layer.
        Should be unique in a model (do not reuse the same name twice).
        It will be autogenerated if it isn't provided.
    dtype: The data type expected by the input, as a string
        (`float32`, `float64`, `int32`...)
    sparse: A boolean specifying whether the placeholder
        to be created is sparse.
    tensor: Optional existing tensor to wrap into the `Input` layer.
        If set, the layer will not create a placeholder tensor.


#### Returns:

    A tensor.

Example:

    ```python
    # this is a logistic regression in Keras
    x = Input(shape=(32,))
    y = Dense(16, activation='softmax')(x)
    model = Model(x, y)
    ```
