## Class `RNNCell`

Abstract object representing an RNN cell.

Inherits From: [`Layer`](../../../../../tf/compat/v1/layers/Layer)

<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

Every `RNNCell` must have the properties below and implement `call` with
the signature `(output, next_state) = call(input, state)`.  The optional
third input argument, `scope`, is allowed for backwards compatibility
purposes; but should be left off for new subclasses.

This definition of cell differs from the definition used in the literature.
In the literature, 'cell' refers to an object with a single scalar output.
This definition refers to a horizontal array of such units.

An RNN cell, in the most abstract setting, is anything that has
a state and performs some operation that takes a matrix of inputs.
This operation results in an output matrix with `self.output_size` columns.
If `self.state_size` is an integer, this operation also results in a new
state matrix with `self.state_size` columns.  If `self.state_size` is a
(possibly nested tuple of) TensorShape object(s), then it should return a
matching structure of Tensors having shape `[batch_size].concatenate(s)`
for each `s` in `self.batch_size`.

DEPRECATED FUNCTION

Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Stop using this property because tf.layers layers no longer track their graph.

<h3 id="output_size"><code>output_size</code></h3>

Integer or TensorShape: size of outputs produced by this cell.


<h3 id="scope_name"><code>scope_name</code></h3>




<h3 id="state_size"><code>state_size</code></h3>

size(s) of state(s) used by this cell.

It can be represented by an Integer, a TensorShape or a tuple of Integers
or TensorShapes.

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r2.0/tensorflow/python/ops/rnn_cell_impl.py#L281-L309">View source</a>

``` python
get_initial_state(
    inputs=None,
    batch_size=None,
    dtype=None
)
```




<h3 id="zero_state"><code>zero_state</code></h3>

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r2.0/tensorflow/python/ops/rnn_cell_impl.py#L311-L340">View source</a>

``` python
zero_state(
    batch_size,
    dtype
)
```

Return zero-filled state tensor(s).


#### Args:


* <b>`batch_size`</b>: int, float, or unit Tensor representing the batch size.
* <b>`dtype`</b>: the data type to use for the state.


#### Returns:

If `state_size` is an int or TensorShape, then the return value is a
`N-D` tensor of shape `[batch_size, state_size]` filled with zeros.

If `state_size` is a nested list or tuple, then the return value is
a nested list or tuple (of the same structure) of `2-D` tensors with
the shapes `[batch_size, s]` for each s in `state_size`.
