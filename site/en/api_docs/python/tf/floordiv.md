# tf.floordiv

### `tf.floordiv`

``` python
floordiv(
    x,
    y,
    name=None
)
```



Defined in [`tensorflow/python/ops/math_ops.py`](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.2/tensorflow/python/ops/math_ops.py).

See the guide: [Math > Arithmetic Operators](../../../api_guides/python/math_ops#Arithmetic_Operators)

Divides `x / y` elementwise, rounding toward the most negative integer.

The same as `tf.div(x,y)` for integers, but uses `tf.floor(tf.div(x,y))` for
floating point arguments so that the result is always an integer (though
possibly an integer represented as floating point).  This op is generated by
`x // y` floor division in Python 3 and in Python 2.7 with
`from __future__ import division`.

Note that for efficiency, `floordiv` uses C semantics for negative numbers
(unlike Python and Numpy).

`x` and `y` must have the same type, and the result will have the same type
as well.

#### Args:

* <b>`x`</b>: `Tensor` numerator of real numeric type.
* <b>`y`</b>: `Tensor` denominator of real numeric type.
* <b>`name`</b>: A name for the operation (optional).


#### Returns:

  `x / y` rounded down (except possibly towards zero for negative integers).


#### Raises:

* <b>`TypeError`</b>: If the inputs are complex.
