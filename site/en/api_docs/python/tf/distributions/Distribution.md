# tf.distributions.Distribution

## Class `Distribution`



### Aliases:

* Class `tf.contrib.distributions.Distribution`
* Class `tf.distributions.Distribution`



Defined in [`tensorflow/python/ops/distributions/distribution.py`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.12/tensorflow/python/ops/distributions/distribution.py).

A generic probability distribution base class.

`Distribution` is a base class for constructing and organizing properties
(e.g., mean, variance) of random variables (e.g, Bernoulli, Gaussian).

#### Subclassing

Subclasses are expected to implement a leading-underscore version of the
same-named function. The argument signature should be identical except for
the omission of `name="..."`. For example, to enable `log_prob(value,
name="log_prob")` a subclass should implement `_log_prob(value)`.

Subclasses can append to public-level docstrings by providing
docstrings for their method specializations. For example:

```python
@util.AppendDocstring("Some other details.")
def _log_prob(self, value):
  ...
```

would add the string "Some other details." to the `log_prob` function
docstring. This is implemented as a simple decorator to avoid python
linter complaining about missing Args/Returns/Raises sections in the
partial docstrings.

#### Broadcasting, batching, and shapes

All distributions support batches of independent distributions of that type.
The batch shape is determined by broadcasting together the parameters.

The shape of arguments to `__init__`, `cdf`, `log_cdf`, `prob`, and
`log_prob` reflect this broadcasting, as does the return value of `sample` and
`sample_n`.

`sample_n_shape = [n] + batch_shape + event_shape`, where `sample_n_shape` is
the shape of the `Tensor` returned from `sample_n`, `n` is the number of
samples, `batch_shape` defines how many independent distributions there are,
and `event_shape` defines the shape of samples from each of those independent
distributions. Samples are independent along the `batch_shape` dimensions, but
not necessarily so along the `event_shape` dimensions (depending on the
particulars of the underlying distribution).

Using the `Uniform` distribution as an example:

```python
minval = 3.0
maxval = [[4.0, 6.0],
          [10.0, 12.0]]

# Broadcasting:
# This instance represents 4 Uniform distributions. Each has a lower bound at
# 3.0 as the `minval` parameter was broadcasted to match `maxval`'s shape.
u = Uniform(minval, maxval)

# `event_shape` is `TensorShape([])`.
event_shape = u.event_shape
# `event_shape_t` is a `Tensor` which will evaluate to [].
event_shape_t = u.event_shape_tensor()

# Sampling returns a sample per distribution. `samples` has shape
# [5, 2, 2], which is [n] + batch_shape + event_shape, where n=5,
# batch_shape=[2, 2], and event_shape=[].
samples = u.sample_n(5)

# The broadcasting holds across methods. Here we use `cdf` as an example. The
# same holds for `log_cdf` and the likelihood functions.

# `cum_prob` has shape [2, 2] as the `value` argument was broadcasted to the
# shape of the `Uniform` instance.
cum_prob_broadcast = u.cdf(4.0)

# `cum_prob`'s shape is [2, 2], one per distribution. No broadcasting
# occurred.
cum_prob_per_dist = u.cdf([[4.0, 5.0],
                           [6.0, 7.0]])

# INVALID as the `value` argument is not broadcastable to the distribution's
# shape.
cum_prob_invalid = u.cdf([4.0, 5.0, 6.0])
```

#### Shapes

There are three important concepts associated with TensorFlow Distributions
shapes:
- Event shape describes the shape of a single draw from the distribution;
  it may be dependent across dimensions. For scalar distributions, the event
  shape is `[]`. For a 5-dimensional MultivariateNormal, the event shape is
  `[5]`.
- Batch shape describes independent, not identically distributed draws, aka a
  "collection" or "bunch" of distributions.
- Sample shape describes independent, identically distributed draws of batches
  from the distribution family.

The event shape and the batch shape are properties of a Distribution object,
whereas the sample shape is associated with a specific call to `sample` or
`log_prob`.

For detailed usage examples of TensorFlow Distributions shapes, see
[this tutorial](
https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/blob/master/tensorflow_probability/examples/jupyter_notebooks/Understanding_TensorFlow_Distributions_Shapes.ipynb)

#### Parameter values leading to undefined statistics or distributions.

Some distributions do not have well-defined statistics for all initialization
parameter values. For example, the beta distribution is parameterized by
positive real numbers `concentration1` and `concentration0`, and does not have
well-defined mode if `concentration1 < 1` or `concentration0 < 1`.

The user is given the option of raising an exception or returning `NaN`.

```python
a = tf.exp(tf.matmul(logits, weights_a))
b = tf.exp(tf.matmul(logits, weights_b))

# Will raise exception if ANY batch member has a < 1 or b < 1.
dist = distributions.beta(a, b, allow_nan_stats=False)
mode = dist.mode().eval()

# Will return NaN for batch members with either a < 1 or b < 1.
dist = distributions.beta(a, b, allow_nan_stats=True)  # Default behavior
mode = dist.mode().eval()
```

In all cases, an exception is raised if *invalid* parameters are passed, e.g.

```python
# Will raise an exception if any Op is run.
negative_a = -1.0 * a  # beta distribution by definition has a > 0.
dist = distributions.beta(negative_a, b, allow_nan_stats=True)
dist.mean().eval()
```

<h2 id="__init__"><code>__init__</code></h2>

``` python
__init__(
    dtype,
    reparameterization_type,
    validate_args,
    allow_nan_stats,
    parameters=None,
    graph_parents=None,
    name=None
)
```

Constructs the `Distribution`.

**This is a private method for subclass use.**

#### Args:

* <b>`dtype`</b>: The type of the event samples. `None` implies no type-enforcement.
* <b>`reparameterization_type`</b>: Instance of `ReparameterizationType`.
    If `distributions.FULLY_REPARAMETERIZED`, this
    `Distribution` can be reparameterized in terms of some standard
    distribution with a function whose Jacobian is constant for the support
    of the standard distribution. If `distributions.NOT_REPARAMETERIZED`,
    then no such reparameterization is available.
* <b>`validate_args`</b>: Python `bool`, default `False`. When `True` distribution
    parameters are checked for validity despite possibly degrading runtime
    performance. When `False` invalid inputs may silently render incorrect
    outputs.
* <b>`allow_nan_stats`</b>: Python `bool`, default `True`. When `True`, statistics
    (e.g., mean, mode, variance) use the value "`NaN`" to indicate the
    result is undefined. When `False`, an exception is raised if one or
    more of the statistic's batch members are undefined.
* <b>`parameters`</b>: Python `dict` of parameters used to instantiate this
    `Distribution`.
* <b>`graph_parents`</b>: Python `list` of graph prerequisites of this
    `Distribution`.
* <b>`name`</b>: Python `str` name prefixed to Ops created by this class. Default:
    subclass name.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: if any member of graph_parents is `None` or not a `Tensor`.



## Properties

<h3 id="allow_nan_stats"><code>allow_nan_stats</code></h3>

Python `bool` describing behavior when a stat is undefined.

Stats return +/- infinity when it makes sense. E.g., the variance of a
Cauchy distribution is infinity. However, sometimes the statistic is
undefined, e.g., if a distribution's pdf does not achieve a maximum within
the support of the distribution, the mode is undefined. If the mean is
undefined, then by definition the variance is undefined. E.g. the mean for
Student's T for df = 1 is undefined (no clear way to say it is either + or -
infinity), so the variance = E[(X - mean)**2] is also undefined.

#### Returns:

* <b>`allow_nan_stats`</b>: Python `bool`.

as,

```none
Cov[i, j] = Covariance(X_i, X_j) = E[(X_i - E[X_i]) (X_j - E[X_j])]
```

where `Cov` is a (batch of) `k x k` matrix, `0 <= (i, j) < k`, and `E`
denotes expectation.

Alternatively, for non-vector, multivariate distributions (e.g.,
matrix-valued, Wishart), `Covariance` shall return a (batch of) matrices
under some vectorization of the events, i.e.,

```none
Cov[i, j] = Covariance(Vec(X)_i, Vec(X)_j) = [as above]
```

where `Cov` is a (batch of) `k' x k'` matrices,

mapping indices of this distribution's event dimensions to indices of a
length-`k'` vector.

)
```

Computes the Kullback--Leibler divergence.

Denote this distribution (`self`) by `p` and the `other` distribution by
`q`. Assuming `p, q` are absolutely continuous with respect to reference
measure `r`, the KL divergence is defined as:

```none
KL[p, q] = E_p[log(p(X)/q(X))]
         = -int_F p(x) log q(x) dr(x) + int_F p(x) log p(x) dr(x)
         = H[p, q] - H[p]

                         = Log[ 1 - cdf(x) ]
```

Typically, different numerical approximations can be used for the log
survival function, which are more accurate than `1 - cdf(x)` when `x >> 1`.
